Install OWI Squad Server on Windows or Linux. Additionally configure the server, and install mods.


## Windows notes

Because of licensing issues, the user must spin up their own Windows instance configured with WinRM before this playbook will run against it. See https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/windows_winrm.html#what-is-winrm
